History

Jan 9, 1999	Alex
		Physical port of files completed.

Jan 9, 1999	Bruce
		Observe and chase mode hooks into NH code.

		Fixed files:
			flashlight.c	
			g_IRgoggles.c
			g_cmd_observe.c --> Mostly obsolete.
			p_nhmenu.c --> Mostly obsolete. 
			p_nhscoreboard.c --> Requires more fixes for chase.
			p_weapon.c

Jan 10, 1999	Alex
		Had to totally rethink the obs/chase stuff as we are now
		using the 3.20 stuff.  Using stuff commnads to change obs
		mode etc to no deviate away from 3.20 code

		Port pretty much done.  Menus, flares, hud etc all working.
		Just requires tuning for menu speed etc due to new
		spectator and chase code


Jan 11, 1999	Sped up menus etc by creating spectator_quick_switch var
		and checking for it in p_client.c so that spectator_respawn
		is called quicker.  I put it in p_client to ensure all other
		functions are processes as usual to prevent odd things from
		happening

		Created 1.5.backup8

Jan 11, 1999	Bruce

		Added Marine initial weapon cvar.
		Modified g_local.h, g_main.c, g_save.c, p_client.c

		Added init_marine_weapon cvar.
		Altered p_client::InitClientPersistent to use this to
		set marine start weapon.
	
		Altered server config file. 


		Added Predator weapon overload.
		Modified g_local.h, g_main.c, g_save.c, p_weapon.c
		and added g_cmd_overload.h and g_cmd_overload.c

		Added allow_predator_overload cvar.
		Added console command "overload" to toggle flag.
		Added flag to client structure.
		Altered Weapon_RocketLauncher_Fire to use flag.

Jan 13, 1999	Alex

		Changed damage for Railgun.  I missed an isPredator
		in p_weapon, so pred only had 100 rail damage.  Should
		have been 150.

		Added to g_cmds.c a check for isObserving for kill
		command like in 1.44.4b, just in case..  shouldn't
		need to kill youself anyways while obs or chasing..

		Created 1.5.backup9

Jan 14, 1999	Alex
		Added to above check in g_cmds.c to also prevent predator
		 from killing itself

		Added check for !ent->client->chase_target to G_SetIREffects
		 function in g_IRgoggles to prevent IR in chase
		
		Added message when a marine kills another in p_client.c:
                  You're NOT supposed to kill other marines!!!....
                
		Added (%s) and attacker->client->pers.netname to p_client
                 obituary so if pred kills you, you know the pred's name
		
		Added fading lighting effect to p_hud.c
                 MoveClientToIntermission for map changes

		1.5 now contains all updates from 1.44.4a to 1.44.4b!

Jan 15, 1999	Alex:

		Changed nhscoreboard to allow 15 character name
		Removed unneeded --- from end of scroreboard
		Changed ---- to a different character

		Added ent->ShowMOTD to g_local.h
		Created p_motd.c file
		Changed motd.txt to info.txt and changed Menu
		to look for info.txt file instead of motd.txt file
		Added 'motd' command that toggles user's ShowMOTD on/off
		 (commented out for now)
		Changed NHMenu to show 'Server Info' instead of 'Info/MOTD'

		Got rid of those can't find pic errors!  flashlight.c
		after setPredStartHud(ent); I set the STAT_PREDATOR
		picture again.  Somehow it gets cleared for a short time
		after calling the hud which generates the errors.

		Added icon to hud for flashlight.  Added STAT_NHFLASHLIGHT
		 to q_shared.h.  Modified all 3 huds.  Modified flashlight.c
		 to clear/set to picture when on/off.  Fixed missing space
		 in hud definition at end of "endif ".  Changed InitPred
		 function to call ClearFlashlight instead of doing manually
		 Got a pic and called it nhflash.pcx.  Added to g_spawn to
		 allow auto download

		Copied jungle_i.pcx to h_pred.pcx and
		 nightops_i.pcx to h_marine.pcx and copied to server
		 nhunters/pics dir with nhflash.pcx.  Changed p_hud
		 and flashlight to use new filenames and also put
		 in g_spawn.c for auto download

		1.5.backup10 created

		Added to p_weapon.c to overload fire for rl to offset
		 second fire by 25 to the left.

		Added to g_cmds.c flashlight command a check for 
		 isObserving.  If observing, flashlight will enter game

Jan 16, 1999	Alex:
		Changed in p_weapon.c overload offset to go 15 to left,
		 and 15 to right

		Created ClearOverload function in g_cmd_overload.c/h

		Added icon to hud for flashlight.  Added STAT_OVERLOAD to 
		 q_shared.h.  Modified all 3 huds.  Modified player_die
		 to also call ClearOverload after ClearFlashlight.
		 Changed Cmd_Overload_f to not allow on/off when dead or
		 inWaiting like in flashlight.c

		Changed in save.c the default for maxspectators from 4
		 to 64, otherwise when 5 people join server, they can't
		 get to spectator mode and they can run around, but no
		 flashlight etc.
		
		Added to p_client in spectator_respawn code to set
		 isObserving to false if wrong spectator password
		 or too many spectators, just in case.

		Found missing code for ClientBeginServerFrame that
		 caused invalid MOVETYPE 4's as user was able to
		 respawn via mouse click sometimes during pred inWaiting

Jan 22, 1999	Alex:
		Added to p_client.c the NHScoreboard stuff back in for
		MoveClientToIntermission, and changed check before
		calling to ensure that scoreboard isn't already up from
		a user getting killed to hit the fraglimit to remove
		overflow problem.

		Changed meny to say you need to press the flashlight key
		to enter game, and took 'enter game' out of menu
		
		removed Admin from menu
 		
		Added overload to menu bindings and setup command
		Added tempvec2 to rocket stuff

Jan 24, 1999	Bruce
		Previous entry appears to have been lost.
		Recreating
		Created 1.5.backup14
		Fixed overload hud icon so that it only appears when rocket
		launcher is selected weapon for predator.
		Fixed overload rocket "spread" so that spread is consistent
		for all angles. Fix was made in p_weapon.c::
		Weapon_RocketLancher_Fire
		Recompute start point for rockets before each call to 
		fire_rocket. 

Jan 30, 1999	Bruce
		Created 1.5.backup15
		Added CTF positional macro support to g_ctf.c
		Added command "spotrep" to g_cmds.c
		Created g_cmd_spotrep.h and g_cmd_spotrep.c.

		Added spotrep command to setup using 'q' key.
		Moved setup command to seperate file.
		Created g_cmd_setup.h, g_cmd_setup.c. 	
		 
Jan 30, 1999	Alex:
		Created 1.5.backup16
		Copied down IR model and pic from Rogue
		Added p_ir and ir model to g_spawn for download
		Changed quad and invul icons in p_hud.c to p_ir
		Changed quad and invul models in g_items to goggles
		Changed from comhead to p_id in p_hud.c

		-Added to p_view check for inWaiting on check for 
		calcviewoffset to prevent pred view from changing due
		to being dead. also in p_client client_think
		-Changed player_die so that pred can't respawn for 3
		seconds after being killed by marine to allow for new
		pred to see kill etc.  as long as you didn't kill yourself
 		-Moved self->isPredator=false and initPredator to bottom of
		player_die after predator death growl
		-Removed code that made marine look like pred from 
		ClientObituary when pred is killed
		-removed clearflashlight from initpred
		-added clearflashlight and set predator hud to p_client
		after inWaiting timeout occurs
		-added SuicidePredator variable and initialized in 
		p_NHStartClient.  Variable is checked to see whether
		initPredator should be called after dieing.
		 
		-added to player_die so that it gives the same predator 
		death sounds if health goes to -40 for gib etc.
		-added p_flare.pcx and changed in p_hud.c and g_spawn.c

		Added in p_client.c to PutClientInServer to set inWaiting
                to false because when the 'bug' hits, inWaiting is true which
                is what causes the problem for that entity. (from 1.44.4b2)

		Created 1.5.backup17

Jan 31 1999	Bruce
	
		Created 1.5.backup18

		Fixed teleport height problem. For some stupid reason, 
		teleport height was increased by 10 when using recall. 

		Made some minor changes to NH scoreboard handling.

		Added a safety mode.
		Added g_safety.h and g_safety.c.
		Added vars marine_safety_time and predator_safety_time.

Feb 1, 1999	Bruce

		Cleaned up some majoon code in p_client.c
		Re-implemented NHScoreboardMessage in hopes of eliminating
		scoreboard overflows.
		Move some Predator initialization stuff from p_client
		to it's own function in flashlight.c.

		Fixed small problem in predator initialization.

		Added file g_nh_light.*

		Added cvars predator_model, predator_skin, marine_model
		and marine_skin.

		Configurable skins.
		Players are not allowed to have the same model as the predator.
		This is checked in ClientUserInfoChanged.
		Predators may not change skin.
		Players may change skin at any time.

		Light level checking.
		Stufflight turns off repeated stuff of light variables.
		Light variables checked when menu displayed and
		when player dies.
		Cheater has affects applied much like GOD mode.
		Variable checked by stuffing copy to userinfo.
		  
Feb 8, 1999	Alex
		Put back level.be_pred_countdown to prevent console from
		being filled up with predator countdown

		Added setMarineSkin to PutClientInServer as marine
		model wasn't getting changed.  Variable was set, but
		that was it!

		Missing skin setting code from ClietUserInfoChanged that
		was from original source code!  Put it back in but
		only if not predator

		Added new variable - marine_allow_custom and changed
		p_client ClientUserInfoChanged and new q_model.c files
		to check before changing the model

Feb 9, 1999	Continued with this code (from backup21).  Moved other code
		to 1.5.dingbat.  Added hum back to flashlight.  Missing line 
		from p_view.c

Feb 9, 1999	Bruce
		My turn. Fixed problem in setMarineSkin.

		powerup, armor, weapon, ammo, bandolier, 
		power armor, ammo pack, etc.
		Safety mode also ends when player changes weapon.
		Bug #1.

		Fixed problem with weapon switching when out of ammo.
		Players do not automatically switch to rocket launcher
		when out of ammo.
		Strangely, this seems to have been omitted from the
		base Q2 code. 
		Bug #2.
   
		Added nh_statusbar. The grand unified hud. 
		Re-organized G_SetStats so that it is clearer.
		STAT assignments are now in order. 
		Added STAT_COUNT.
		Predator countdown will not work in hud due to handling
		of switchover to predator.
		

Feb 12, 1999	Bruce 
		Large number of changed.

		Create p_predator.h and p_predator.c.
		Moved LookforPredator to this file and renamed it	
		lookForPredator.
		Created switchPredator and startPredator. 

		Predator switching now handled without respawning
		player.

		Slightly altered handing of MOTD.
		Changed motd command to call ShowMOTD.
		ShowMOTD now sets ent->ShowMOTD to level.time + 15 secs.
		G_SetStats checks for ent->ShowMOTD > level.time.
		If so, it sets the layout. 

		ShowMOTD() called in ClientBeginDeathMatch.
	
		Where the hell is the menu called?

		Many bugs.
		Calling ShowMOTD where menu was called.

Feb 13, 1999	Bruce
		Progress.
		Predator switch over now appears to be solid.
		Temporarily set player to DEAD_DEAD.
		This seems to fix the movement.
		Clear flashlight before entering inWaiting.

		Moved flashlight and overload icons in hud.
		This is because the teleport shots and panic timer
		can dissapear from hud and it looks kinda strange.

Feb 13, 1999	Alex	 
		Made backup25

Feb 15, 1999	Bruce
		Fucking-A!

		Added new cvar "motd_time": Hang time for motd.

		Added hook in p_view:ClientEndServerFrame for menu.
  		Menu is automatically displayed when MOTD dissapears.

		Added check for scoreboard messages.
		If menu is up, don't update scoreboard display.

		Menu actually uses ent->showscores. So, menu will
		also activate scoreboard, unless check for menu is made.

		Moved icons to lower part of hud.
		Overload icon used with ammo icon location.

		Changed display of motd to relative coordinates.

		Removed anti-cheat tests.

		blank, sets maplist_small_max and medium to 999 so it 
		doesn't crash on null strings etc.

		Made backup28

		Bruce
		Slightly altered q_model.c so that marines check against
		current predator model, not the server variable.

		Bruce
		Set ent->SuicidePredator in p_predator:switchPredator.c
				
Feb 28, 1999	Bruce
		Added cvar checks for all model and skin cvars (except
		for allow_marine_custom, which is trivial).
		Altered all references to skins cvars to use new functions.
		Create new predator model variable which is used to 
		make sure marine is not using same model as predator.
		All model/skin cvars use CVAR_NOSET, which disables the
		setting of custom skins etc from console.	


March 1, 1999	Alex
		Commented out setHud and setNHHud functions in 
		g_spawn.c.  Nothing is calling them.
		Added ent->ShowMOTD = 0 to spectator_respawn to clear the
		 motd when player starts to play
		Added MOTD to menu
		Changed MOTD command to toggle MOTD on / off in g_cmds.c

		 so that it's always checked
		Added ShowMOTD = 0 to NHScore_f to clear MOTD when

		Temporarily put PutClientInServer in initPredator

		
March 15, 1999	Bruce
		Altered p_client.c
		In player_die.
		Prior to predator switch, check to see if attacker is dead.
		If so, put the attacker back in the server before switching.
		This is done via call to PutClientInServer(attacker).

		Addded cvar penalty_threshold.
		This cvar takes a value between 0 and maxmarinekill
		When > 0, if the marine has a maxmarinekill >= threshold,
		then marine has penalty applied. 
		Penalty is some client effect.
		Penalty is only applied when safety mode not in force.

		Changed TossClientWeapon in p_client.c
		Marine flares are no longer dropped when marines killed.

		Even though it was not technically a "bug", I changed
		the teleport anchor function so that it issues a warning
		if no teleport shots are left.

		Moved the flashlight icon down another 5 pixels. 
		See if that suffices.

		Added new functions to p_predator.c
		Designed to facilitate the predator -> spectator move.

		 so the original was running first which always showed old
		 scoreboard first.
		Added to p_view fov chase code a check to make sure FOV 
		 is >1 and <160 before trying to duplicate fov of person
		 being chased.  I disconnected once due to a bad fov
		 of 0.000000.  User I was chasing also disconnecte because
		 his fov was set to 0!  His fault, but this is a safe guard
		Removed flag2 effect from predator while inWaiting from
		 playerEffects in flashlight.c

April 24, 1999	Alex
		In g_nh.c, added on PreConnect pers.spectator=true and
