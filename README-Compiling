Please use GCC 2.7.2.3 to compile this or any other Quake2 mod.

If you use EGCS (included with RedHat and Mandrake) it WILL compile
but you will probably get a segmentation fault or some other crash
as soon as you try to run the Quake2 server with the compiled
source.

It may run fine if compiled with GCC 2.95, but it is known not to
run if compiled with EGCS.
